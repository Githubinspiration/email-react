## 1. Install

We recommend using `create-email`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npx create-email@latest
```

```sh yarn
yarn create email
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create a new folder called `emails` with a few email templates.

## 2. Run locally

Start the development server.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm run dev
```

```sh yarn
yarn dev
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. See changes live

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and edit any of the files on the `emails` folder to see the changes.
