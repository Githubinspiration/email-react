## 1. Create workspace

Create a new folder called `transactional` inside of where you keep workspace packages (generally `./packages/*`).

Include a new `package.json` and do not forget to add this to the `workspaces` of your monorepo's `package.json`.

## 2. Add the preview client to your workspaces

Currently, for React Email to work properly with npm's workspaces, you will need to add
the preview client's folder to the workspaces as follows:

```json package.json
{
  // ...
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "packages/transactional/.react-email"],
  // ...
}
```

## 3. Install dependencies

Install React Email in the `transactional` workspace.

```sh packages/transactional
npm install react-email @react-email/components -E
```

## 4. Add scripts

Include the following script in your `package.json` file.

```json packages/transactional/package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "email dev"
  }
  // ...
}
```

## 5. Write your emails

Create a new folder called `emails`, create a file inside called `MyEmail.tsx` and add the following example code:

```jsx packages/transactional/emails/MyEmail.tsx
import { Button, Html } from "@react-email/components";
import * as React from "react";

export const MyEmail = () => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Button
        href="https://example.com"
        style={{ background: "#000", color: "#fff", padding: "12px 20px" }}
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default MyEmail;
```

## 6. Run preview server

Start the email previews development server:

```sh packages/transactional
npm run dev
```

## 7. See changes live

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and edit the `emails/MyEmail.tsx` file to see the changes.
