## 1. Create workspace

Create a new folder called `transactional` inside of where you keep workspace packages (generally `./packages/*`) and 
in there setup a new `package.json` and do not forget to add this to your `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## 2. Install dependencies

Install React Email in the `transactional` workspace.

```sh packages/transactional
pnpm add react-email @react-email/components -E
```

## 3. Add scripts

Include the following script in your `package.json` file.

```json packages/transactional/package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "email dev"
  }
  // ...
}
```

## 4. Write your emails

Create a new folder called `emails`, create a file inside called `MyEmail.tsx` and add the following example code:

```jsx packages/transactional/emails/MyEmail.tsx
import { Button, Html } from "@react-email/components";
import * as React from "react";

export const MyEmail = () => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Button
        href="https://example.com"
        style={{ background: "#000", color: "#fff", padding: "12px 20px" }}
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default MyEmail;
```

## 5. Run preview server

Start the email previews development server:

```sh packages/transactional
pnpm dev
```
