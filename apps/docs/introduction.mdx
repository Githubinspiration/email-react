## Introduction

React Email is a collection of high-quality, unstyled components for creating beautiful emails.
It reduces the pain of coding responsive emails with dark mode support. It also takes care of inconsistencies between Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients for you.

## Why

We believe that email is an extremely important medium for people to communicate. However, we need to stop developing emails like 2010, and rethink how email can be done in 2022 and beyond. Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build web apps today.

## Components

This is a set of standard components to help you build amazing emails without having to deal with the mess of creating table-based layouts and maintaining archaic markup.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="HTML" icon={regular('code')} href="/components/html">

  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Container"
    icon={regular('objects-column')}
    href="/components/container"
  >
    The main wrapper that hold your content.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Button"
    icon={regular('rectangle-wide')}
    href="/components/button"
  >
    A React button component to help build emails.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text" icon={regular('font')} href="/components/text">
    A block of text separated by blank spaces.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integrations

In order to use React Email with any email service provider, you'll need to convert the components made with React into a HTML string. This is done using the [render](/utilities/render) utility.
