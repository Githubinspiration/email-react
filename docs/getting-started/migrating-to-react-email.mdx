## From MJML

### Manual

1. Remove the `mjml` npm package and install `react-email` and `@react-email/components`
2. Find all MJML templates ending with the `.mjml` extension and convert these to React components with the `.tsx` or `.jsx` extension.
3. Replace MJML standard component tags with React Email component tags where possible, including `<Text>`, `<Image>`, `<Button>` etc.
4. Convert custom MJML components with the `.js` extension to React components with the `.tsx` or `.jsx` extension.

### Automated

If you have a lot of MJML files to convert, this migration can be quite tedious!  You can also automate this process with Second's [MJML â†’ React Email](https://www.second.dev) migration module.  Just connect Second to your GitHub repo, run the module, and get a pull request.
