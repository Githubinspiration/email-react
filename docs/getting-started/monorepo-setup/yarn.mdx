<Note>
  This is a guide intended at users of [yarn modern](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#why-should-you-upgrade-to-yarn-modern). 
  For those who are using [yarn classic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (`1.x`), you can do something similar to the 
  [pnpm guide](/getting-started/monorepo-setup/pnpm).
</Note>

## 1. Create transactional workspace

Create a new folder called `transactional` inside of where you keep workspace packages (generally `./packages/*`).

Include a new `package.json` and do not forget to add this to the `workspaces` of your monorepo's `package.json`.

## 2. Set linker either to `node-modules` or to `pnpm`

Currently, React Email can only work with yarn's `node-modules` and `pnpm` [install modes](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers)
so you will need to set it to one of these two on your `.yarnrc.yml` file:

```yml .yarnrc.yml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

## 3. Add the preview client to your workspaces

Currently, for React Email to work properly with yarn, you will need to add
the preview client's folder to the workspaces as follows:

```json package.json
{
  // ...
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "packages/transactional/.react-email"],
  // ...
}
```

## 4. Install dependencies

Install React Email in the `transactional` workspace.

```sh packages/transactional
yarn add react-email @react-email/components -E
```

## 5. Add scripts

Include the following script in your `package.json` file.

```json packages/transactional/package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "email dev"
  }
  // ...
}
```

## 6. Write your emails

Create a new folder called `emails`, create a file inside called `MyEmail.tsx` and add the following example code:

```jsx packages/transactional/emails/MyEmail.tsx
import { Button, Html } from "@react-email/components";
import * as React from "react";

export const MyEmail = () => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Button
        href="https://example.com"
        style={{ background: "#000", color: "#fff", padding: "12px 20px" }}
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default MyEmail;
```

## 7. Run preview server

Start the email previews development server:

```sh packages/transactional
yarn dev
```

## 8. See changes live

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and edit the `emails/MyEmail.tsx` file to see the changes.
